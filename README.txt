This is the group 6 exam project
Contributors are Trygve Kristiansen, Ritha Willio and Silja Hanseth

We got the original files "exam_dataset.txt"" and "exam_joindata.txt". They contain information on a study on wheter pretreatment with indometacin would decrease the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP. The variable info is listed in codebook.html.
The assignment for the data is described in "exam_desc.md"

We explored the dataset to see what needed changes/tidying. 

We cleaned the data: deleted 2 column names, renamed two columns, changed some variable types, made sure each variable was one column, deleted duplicates

We wrangled the data: We fulljoined the datasets into mydata_joined2024-09-12.txt. We changed the name of some variables, added subset groups, mutated some of the variables. 
We analysed  some of the questions by making plots using ggplot2. 
All of this is found in the folder "scripts"
The final file is named "finaldata.txt""

We uploaded the project to Github under the name "trygvetrophomonas/Group_6_project"
We added the license for that, see separate file

We created a final report in R markdown, "report Group 6.rmd"
